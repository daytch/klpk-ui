              Welcome to the KLPK App platform. These terms of service ("Terms
              of Service") are a contract between you and KLPK App. By using
              KLPK App.com (the "Site"), creating your KLPK App account and
              using the Site or our mobile applications to post various content
              to the KLPK App community, including stories you create, comments
              and messages, or to access and view KLPK App content or other user
              content (together with the Site, the "Services"), you're agreeing
              to these Terms of Service. If you don't agree to any of these
              terms, you can't use the KLPK App Services.

              You can browse very much on the Site or use the Services without
              registering for an account. To get the most out of the KLPK App
              platform, you'll need to register, choose an account name, and set
              a password.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base text-kplkWhite">
              You're responsible for all the activity on your account, and for
              keeping your password confidential. If you share your account
              information with anyone, that other person may be able to take
              control of the account, and we may not be able to determine who is
              the proper account holder. We will not have any liability to you
              (or anyone you share your account information with) as a result of
              your or their actions under those circumstances. If you find out
              that someone's used your account without your permission, you
              should report it at support@KLPKApp.com

              Before posting any content to KLPK App, it is important that you
              read our guidline. If your content does not comply with these

              You own all the rights to the content you create and post on the
              KLPK App Services. Of course, if the content wasn't yours to begin
              with, putting it on KLPK App doesn't make it yours. Don't submit
              content you don't hold the copyright for (unless you have
              permission, including to grant KLPK App all the rights outlined in
              these terms).

            <p className="text-base text-kplkWhite mb-2">
              When you post content to KLPK App, we need the legal permission
              under applicable copyright laws to display that content to users
              of the KLPK App Services. Legally this means you give us a
              nonexclusive license to publish your content on the KLPK App
              Services, including anything reasonably related to publishing it
              (like storing, displaying, reformatting, and distributing it).

              You're responsible for the content you post. This means you assume

              someone else's reliance on its accuracy and any claims relating to
              intellectual property or other legal rights.

              KLPK App is a free service and to continue to make it free you
              understand that we enable advertising on the Services, including
              in connection with the display of your content or other
              information. We may also use your Content to promote the Services.
              We will never sell your content to third parties without your
              explicit permission.

              In your use of the Services you may enter into additional terms
              and conditions and other agreements that alter or override these
              Terms of Service, such as when you enter a contest or join a
              special program like our KLPK App Stars. In case of any conflict
              or inconsistency, the terms and conditions of those additional
              terms and agreements would override these Terms of Service.
